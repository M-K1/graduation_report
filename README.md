# Graduation_report
Here you can find the scripts used during my graduation intership.
The original goal of this project was to determine which sequencing method (VirCapSeq-VERT/long amplicon sequencing) would be better in quickly, accurately and precisely detecting and distinguishing different genotypes as replacement of Sanger sequencing and qPCR. Due to SARS-CoV-2, not all activities could be completed before the deadline of the internship and a shift in direction was needed. SARS-CoV-2 would also be included in this report since assistance was needed for the analysis of new sequencing data and compensation for the missing aspects of this project was necessary.
# Flowchart
Below you can see the original flowchart created for this project. The final workflow has deviated from the original workflow described in this flowchart but the general steps are still the same.
